# Snake Gaming Application Using JAVA Swing Components

This is a simple Snake gaming application developed in Java using Swing components. The application utilizes JFrame and JPanel to create a graphical user interface (GUI) with a game board of size 600x600 pixels. Players can control the movement of the snake using keyboard inputs.

### Features
