# Console Application Branch

This branch of the ZSGS Training Assessments repository focuses on various Java console applications. Each application within this branch demonstrates different programming concepts and problem-solving scenarios.

## List of Console Applications

1. **Chat Bot Application (Package: com.subramanians.chatbot):**
   - It is an simple java console application, which follows MVVM architecture.
   - This application was developed to understand the usage of stack data-structure.
   - It displays options based on user-input and the data for user response is retrieved from JSON file using simple-json library.
   - Run ChatBot.java file in this [package](https://github.com/subramanian-s-043/Java_Practice_Problems/tree/Console_Application/src/com/subramanians/chatbot) to start the application.

2. **Cricket Score-Board (Package: com.subramanians.cricketscore):**
   - A java console application to show the score-card of the cricket match in real-time.
   - It follows MVVM aritechture and MySql as database for storage and retrieval.
   - The application functions as a real-time scoreboard. Users simply input the outcome of the previous ballâ€”whether it's 0-4, 6, Wicket (W), Wide (WD), or No Ball (NB). The application automatically manages individual batsmen scores, tracks changes in overs between batsmen, updates the next batsmen in the lineup, and handles events like innings changes.
   - To start the application, Run CricketScoreShower.java file in this [package](https://github.com/subramanian-s-043/Java_Practice_Problems/tree/Console_Application/src/com/subramanians/cricketscore).

3. **Interview Panel (Package: com.subramanians.interviewpanel):**
   - It is an simple java console application to schedule interview for the candidates on first-come-first serve order.
   - It uses MVVM architecture to demonstrate how queues work.
   - Threading is implemented for handling interviews concurrently.
   - To run this application, execute InterviewPanel.java file in this [package](https://github.com/subramanian-s-043/Java_Practice_Problems/tree/Console_Application/src/com/subramanians/interviewpanel).

4. **Role Hierarchy (Package: com.subramanians.rolehierarchy):**
   - It is an simple java console application to maintain a company's authority hirerarchy.
   - It uses MVVM architecture and MySql as database.
   - To start the application, run the RoleHierarchy.java in this [package](https://github.com/subramanian-s-043/Java_Practice_Problems/tree/Console_Application/src/com/subramanians/rolehierarchy).

5. **Restaurant Table Booking (Package: com.subramanians.tablebooking):**
   - A Java console app for reserving restaurant tables.
   - It's built with MVVM architecture and relies on a MySQL database.
   - Two logins: admin and user.
   - Users can book tables at any available restaurant.
   - Restaurant availability is controlled by the restaurant admin.
   - Import the sql tables from [here](https://github.com/subramanian-s-043/Java_Practice_Problems/tree/Console_Application/src/com/subramanians/tablebooking/sqltables).
   - To run the application, execute RestaurantTableBooking.java in this [package](https://github.com/subramanian-s-043/Java_Practice_Problems/tree/Console_Application/src/com/subramanians/tablebooking)

5. **Tic-Tac-Toe Application (Package: com.subramanians.tictactoe):**
   - Simple java gaming application.
   - It follows MVVM architecture.
   - Only multiplayers can play.
   - To start application, run TicTacToe.java in this [package](https://github.com/subramanian-s-043/Java_Practice_Problems/tree/Console_Application/src/com/subramanians/tictactoe).

5. **Railway Reservation System (Package: com.subramanians.trainreservationsystem):**
   - Simple train reservation console application.
   - It follows MVVM architecture.
   - It has features like Waiting List(WL),RAC.
   - To run the application, execute TrainReservationSystem.java in this [package](https://github.com/subramanian-s-043/Java_Practice_Problems/tree/Console_Application/src/com/subramanians/trainreservationsystem).
